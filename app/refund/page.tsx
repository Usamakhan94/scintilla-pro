We provide limitless free revisions for the first four weeks, after which no refunds will be given. If the customer is still unhappy after the changes, our quality assurance staff will examine the work and determine the correct amount to return. It is the customer's obligation to examine the quality of the draughts and contact us immediately in the case of orders where the client is given the draughts. If the reported problem is not resolved in the final project and has harmed the overall quality, a refund will be issued. There will be no reimbursement if the concerns are not reported from the beginning and are brought up at the conclusion for a refund.`}
